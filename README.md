# beginnerprojects
in this folder, i aim to share some basic python projects for those who has difficulties to understand basic python and generall programming algorithms. 
I do not deny benefit of watching online tutorials. however, i believe beginners should try hard to understand basics and force themselves to write small projects 
by using their own (good or bad) algorithms. so in this folder especially i target these group.
